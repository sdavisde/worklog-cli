# Worklog CLI Tool (`wl`)

A modular CLI tool for daily task and time tracking with simple Markdown-based notes, designed for future AI querying and summarization.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

#### Download from GitHub Releases (Recommended)

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**
```bash
# Download and install in one command
curl -L https://github.com/sdavisde/worklog-cli/releases/latest/download/worklog-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
wl --help
```

#### Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source or need to build for a different platform:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/sdavisde/worklog-cli
cd worklog-cli
cargo build --release

# Install binary and templates
sudo cp target/release/wl /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp -r templates /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
wl --help
```

**Requirements:**
- macOS (currently only macOS Apple Silicon binaries are provided)
- Rust 1.70+ (for building from source only)

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Open today's note in nvim
# TODO: this command should cut all unfinished tasks from the previous note and add them to the current days note
wl open
# or just
wl

# Add a task
wl task "Fix bug in login flow"
# TODO: I put these in "Intake" because i think it'll make sense to do that for work, but it'd be nice for this to be customizable

# View previous day's note
wl last

# Add to ## Notes section (todo)
wl note "Test note"

# Open a specific date (todo)
wl open --date 2025-01-15
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Config.yaml

Edit `~/.worklog/config.yaml` to customize the behavior of worklog.

```yaml
# Default Config

editor_command: nvim

# todo: allow configuration of daily note template
```

### Data Storage

Notes are stored in `~/.worklog/daily-notes/` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## üìù Daily Note Format

Each daily note follows this structure:

```markdown
# 2025-01-15

## Tasks

- [ ] Fix bug in login flow
- [x] Update documentation

### Intake

<!-- Where quick-add tasks are added for later triaging into the tasks section -->
- [ ] Where

## Notes

Meeting with team about new features.
```

## üß† AI-Ready Design

The tool is designed with future AI integration in mind:

- **Structured Data**: Consistent markdown format for easy parsing
- **Sectioned Content**: Clear separation of work types
- **Standardized Format**: Predictable structure for LLM processing
- **Interactive Management**: Easy task completion tracking
- **Future Commands**: Ready for `wl summary`, `wl achievements`, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
# cargo test

# Run the CLI locally
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- open
`cargo run -- tasks
```

### Releasing

Use the provided release script to automate version bumping, tagging, and releasing:

```bash
# Test the release process (dry run)
./release.sh 0.3.1 --dry-run

# Create and publish a release
./release.sh 0.3.1
```

The script will:
1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Run tests to ensure everything works
3. Commit the version bump
4. Create and push a git tag
5. Trigger GitHub Actions to build and publish the release

### Adding New Commands

1. Create a new module in `src/commands/`
2. Implement the command using clap derive macros
3. Add the command to the main CLI enum in `src/main.rs`

### Core Architecture

Built with modern Rust practices:
- **Clap**: Command-line argument parsing with derive macros
- **Chrono**: Date and time handling
- **Serde**: Configuration and data serialization
- **Error handling**: Result types and proper error propagation

## üöß Future Features

- [ ] Interactive task management (`wl tasks`)
- [ ] Cross-day summaries (`wl summary --since 30d`)
- [ ] Tagging system (`wl tag AB#12345 priority:high`)
- [ ] Work review (`wl review`)
- [ ] AI-powered insights and suggestions
